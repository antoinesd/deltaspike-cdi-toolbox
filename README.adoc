== Build environment (only needed the first time)

Install RVM from here http://rvm.io if you don't already have it.

---
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
---

Then run:
----
rake setup
----

== Build instructions

To generate the HTML presentation, run the following command:
----
rake generate
----

== Use Guard and LiveReload

With http://guardgem.org/[Guard] and http://livereload.com/[LiveReload], you can change the content of the doc and have the files automatically generated and your browser updated.

Then install the http://livereload.com/extensions[LiveReload plugin] for your browser (Chrome, Firefox and Safari are supported).

Finally, launch Guard:
----
bundle exec guard
----

Browse to the generated file you want to refresh and activate the LiveReload plugin (don't forget to configure the plugin to accept refreshing local files).
